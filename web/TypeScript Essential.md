# TypeScript Essential

## Introduction

TypeScript is superset of JavaScript. 
Valid JavaScript is also valid for TypeScript. 
JavaScript is weakly typed language. 
Therefore, TypeScript is weakly typed language **with gradual typing**.

Gradual Typing means it has features of statically typed and dynamically typed.
Annotated variables and expressions will be checked and monitored during compilation.
Other variables and expressions will be checked and monitored with the inferred results.

> Dynamically-typed language means type of variable is determined by the stored value at the runtime.
> 
> Statically-typed language means type of variable is determined at compilation and almost the type is declared before. 

> Strongly typed means type coercion is not allowed during operation, and inappropriate data type must do data conversion explicitly.
>
> Weakly typed means value is type coercion to appropriate data type during operation.
>
> *Type coercion is conversion value form one data type to another automatically or implicitly.*

Type Annotation means declare a data type for variables or expressions.

Type Inference means data type is inferred by data type of either assigned variable or result from expression. Simply, It will be performed on all stuffs that is not annotated.
