Strongly typed
Weakly typed

Gradual Typing means it has features of statically typed and dynamically typed. Annotated variables and expressions will be checked and monitored during compilation. Other variables and expressions will be checked and monitored with the inferred results.

Type Annotation means declare a data type for variables or expressions.

Type Inference means data type is inferred by data type of either assigned variable or result from expression. Simply, It will be performed on all stuffs that is not annotated.
